# Sky-Spyre
Sky Spyre (made in Unity) is an epic action adventure through the castle of a ruined kingdom! Explore Sky
Spyre Castle and battle dangerous creatures and wizards in a classic, 2D pixel art style.

You play as Hazel, the former queen of the ruined nation of Genovia. Three wizards used
their magic to conquer the kingdom! Hazel must defeat each wizard and if she ever hopes
to restore peace and harmony in Genovia.

the Wizards Three to save Genovia!
